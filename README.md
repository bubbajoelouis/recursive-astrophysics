Recursive Astrophysical Structure Hypothesis, using the Unified Theory of Energy (UTE) to explain layered Radiation Coordinate Systems. It suggests that parallel solar systems may exist above and below our ecliptic plane, hidden by Radiation Source extension asymmetry.

A paper expanding the Recursive Astrophysical Structure Hypothesis, incorporating the shared Trojan asteroids between neighboring solar systems as a mechanism of material transfer, as well as the Degrees of Surface Interaction applied to planetary evolution

# solar-system-as-molecular-structure.tex
This paper presents an analogy between the structure of our Solar System and the molecular structure of ozone (O$_3$), based on the Unified Theory of Energy (UTE). By leveraging Degrees of Surface Interaction and Scaling (D$_T$ as Newton’s r), we compare the relative distances and interactions of the Solar System’s Trojan Asteroid Lagrange Points (L4 and L5) with the positions of adjacent solar systems. A dual-method verification is conducted: first using standard astrophysical and molecular data, and second through the recursive logic of UTE. Our findings suggest that solar systems do not exist in isolation but are arranged in larger interconnected energy structures analogous to atomic formations, challenging the traditional model of gravitationally bound yet independently existing systems.

Kepler’s Laws describe planetary orbits as elliptical but fail to explain why this shape arises. In this paper, we refine Kepler’s framework using the Unified Theory of Energy (UTE) to demonstrate that planetary orbits are not simply elliptical but are subtly modified into an asymmetric, "egg-shaped" structure due to external gravitational influences. The Trojan Asteroid regions (L4 and L5) of our Solar System indicate two connected neighboring solar systems, forming a large-scale Ozone Molecule analogy in astrophysical structure. This framework explains the role of Jupiter as the stabilizing pivot in a three-system gravitational interaction, fundamentally altering how we understand orbital mechanics.
