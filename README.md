# recursive-astrophysics.tex
Recursive Astrophysical Structure Hypothesis, using the Unified Theory of Energy (UTE) to explain layered Radiation Coordinate Systems. It suggests that parallel solar systems may exist above and below our ecliptic plane, hidden by Radiation Source extension asymmetry.

# neighboring-solar-systems.tex
A paper expanding the Recursive Astrophysical Structure Hypothesis, incorporating the shared Trojan asteroids between neighboring solar systems as a mechanism of material transfer, as well as the Degrees of Surface Interaction applied to planetary evolution
