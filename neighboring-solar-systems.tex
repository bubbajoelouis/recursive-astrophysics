\begin{abstract}
This paper extends the Recursive Astrophysical Structure Hypothesis within the Unified Theory of Energy (UTE), demonstrating that planetary and interstellar material exchange follows the same Degrees of Surface Interaction (D) that define energy transformations. Specifically, we hypothesize that Trojan asteroid regions serve as interstellar gravitational exchange zones, allowing material transfer between solar systems. This suggests that a neighboring solar system's habitable zone may share critical organic molecules and water sources with our own. We also analyze planetary Gravitation and Radiation balance to show why Mars is still at D=4 (unicellular life) but has not yet reached D=5 (multicellular complexity), making its evolutionary timeline many cycles behind Earth's.

\section{Introduction}
The formation and evolution of planetary bodies within a solar system are dictated by the balance of Radiation ($R$) and Gravitation ($G$). The Degrees of Surface Interaction (D) determine the complexity of energy storage and transformation, influencing planetary habitability. While traditional models treat solar systems as isolated, we propose that gravitational exchange through Trojan asteroids at Lagrange points may enable material transfer between neighboring stellar systems.

\section{Trojan Asteroids as Interstellar Exchange Mechanisms}
Trojan asteroids reside in stable Lagrange points (L4, L5) of a planetary system, where the gravitational pull of the star and a gas giant (such as Jupiter) create a long-term equilibrium. If a neighboring solar system has a similar configuration, then:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Trojan asteroids could belong to both systems simultaneously, acting as shared reservoirs of material.
    \item Organic molecules and volatiles could be transferred between systems over astronomical timescales.
    \item This provides a natural mechanism for the spread of water and prebiotic chemistry, influencing the development of life beyond a single solar system.
\end{enumerate}

This means that a habitable \textbf{third-position exoplanet in a neighboring solar system} could receive the same material influx that influenced Earth's biological evolution.

\section{Degrees of Surface Interaction and Planetary Evolution}
Planets evolve based on their ability to store Gravitation ($G$) while still extending Radiation ($R$). The Unified Theory of Energy states:
\begin{quotation}
\textbf{Definition 12}: Life is any system which utilizes the results of Surface Interactions to separate itself from the Surface of a Mass Structure.
\end{quotation}

This implies that the emergence of life follows a strict sequence of Degrees of Surface Interaction:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{D=0}: Basic Radiation absorption and shedding (inert matter).
    \item \textbf{D=1}: Free particle exchange at surfaces (electric charge, valence activity).
    \item \textbf{D=2}: Energy exchange through surface depth (chemical bonds, fusion events).
    \item \textbf{D=3}: Mass structural change (fission, planetary differentiation, geological cycles).
    \item \textbf{D=4}: Unicellular life emerges, forming primitive biological storage and exchange mechanisms.
    \item \textbf{D=5}: Multicellular life arises as specialized cells form structured systems.
    \item \textbf{D=6}: Higher-order cognition and planetary ecosystems develop.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Mars as a D=4 Planet}
Mars exhibits strong evidence for past liquid water and organic chemistry but has not developed the Gravitation necessary to sustain D=5 life. This suggests:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Microbial life (D=4) may exist, but not complex multicellular ecosystems (D=5).
    \item It is many energy cycles away from achieving a biosphere similar to Earth's.
    \item Terraforming Mars requires artificially increasing its stored Gravitation to push it towards D=5.
\end{itemize}

\section{Implications for Solar System Evolution}
If Trojan asteroids act as material exchange points, this suggests:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Neighboring solar systems may have planets that developed under similar conditions to Earth.
    \item Panspermia may be a multi-system process rather than an isolated planetary event.
    \item Astrobiology should focus on identifying Lagrange-point asteroids that may contain interstellar materials.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}
The recursive nature of astrophysical structure suggests that planetary evolution follows Degrees of Surface Interaction, with life emerging at D=4 and higher complexity forming at D=5. Mars has not yet reached D=5, making it an incomplete biosphere in need of additional Gravitation to support multicellular life. Meanwhile, Trojan asteroids may be critical in understanding interstellar material transfer, suggesting that habitable planets in neighboring solar systems may have shared origins with Earth. This recursive perspective provides a framework for unifying planetary evolution with astrophysical interactions.
