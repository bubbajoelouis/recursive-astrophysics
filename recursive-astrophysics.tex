\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a hypothesis extending the Unified Theory of Energy (UTE) to describe the recursive and layered nature of astrophysical structures, particularly solar systems. We challenge the assumption that all celestial structures exist in a flat, D=2 plane and propose that Radiation Coordinate Systems extend in layered, overlapping arrangements. This explains the observed gravitational anomalies, the detection difficulty of parallel solar systems, and the fractalized nature of cosmic structures.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Classical astrophysics assumes that galactic and solar system structures predominantly align within a two-dimensional (D=2) ecliptic plane. However, this oversimplification fails to account for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The asymmetric distribution of radiation.
    \item The existence of neighboring systems potentially obscured by dominant Radiation Sources.
    \item The gravitational anomalies suggesting unseen mass concentrations beyond D=2 projections.
    \item The recursive nature of energy transformations as described by the Unified Theory of Energy (UTE).
\end{itemize}
This paper hypothesizes that solar systems form in \textbf{recursive, parallel layers} rather than existing in a singular plane, and that Radiation Sources inherently define \textbf{nested Radiation Coordinate Systems}.

\section{Radiation Extension and Surface Depth}
The energy distribution of any Radiation Source follows the principle that \textbf{Gravitation is stored energy, while Radiation is extended energy}. The extent to which Radiation extends is dependent on:
\begin{equation}
    R_{extended} = f(D_t, E_{total})
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $D_t$ is the \textbf{Topological Scale}, determining the size of the Radiation Source’s influence.
    \item $E_{total}$ is the \textbf{total available energy}, stored as Gravitation or extended as Radiation.
\end{itemize}
This principle implies that while we observe the strongest Radiation in a dominant plane, additional Radiation layers may exist above and below it, extending from neighboring parallel solar systems.

\section{Theoretical Parallel Solar Systems}
If a \textbf{Radiation Source} emits most strongly along an ecliptic plane (such as our Solar System’s), then \textbf{its weaker Radiation components} extend perpendicularly. This results in:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Parallel solar systems that remain largely undetected due to Radiation extension asymmetry.
    \item Energy exchange occurring through outlier Particles beyond Pluto, forming interstellar conduits.
    \item Observational limitations where telescopes tuned to detect direct ecliptic emissions fail to capture orthogonal sources.
\end{enumerate}
This means that our nearest neighboring systems may exist \textbf{above and below our solar system’s plane, rather than simply along the galactic disk}.

\section{Mathematical Representation of Layered Radiation Coordinate Systems}
We define a \textbf{nested Radiation Coordinate System} as a function of recursive Gravitation storage and Radiation extension:
\begin{equation}
    G_{stored}(r) = \int_{r}^{r_0} E_{G} \, dr, \quad R_{extended}(r) = \int_{r}^{\infty} E_{R} \, dr
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $G_{stored}(r)$ represents energy retained within a given radius $r$.
    \item $R_{extended}(r)$ represents energy extended outward beyond $r$.
    \item $r_0$ is the observed ecliptic boundary of a solar system’s dominant Radiation Source.
    \item Integration limits extend to capture the recursive nature of Radiation energy transitions.
\end{itemize}
This function shows that as we approach \textbf{$r_0$ from the inside}, the system appears isolated, but when extended \textbf{past $r_0$}, neighboring Radiation Sources contribute overlapping fields.

\section{Observational Evidence and Predictions}
This hypothesis makes the following predictions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Gravitational anomalies}—Detected mass beyond observed sources could be the Gravitation storage of neighboring parallel solar systems.
    \item \textbf{Infrared background fluctuations}—Hidden Radiation layers should manifest as diffuse IR radiation beyond standard model predictions.
    \item \textbf{Unexpected interstellar object trajectories}—'Oumuamua and similar objects may be transitional Particles between overlapping Radiation Coordinate Systems.
    \item \textbf{Disproportionate stellar velocity distributions}—If stars follow layered Radiation flows, velocity mapping should reveal inconsistencies in galactic rotation models.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
Traditional astrophysics incorrectly assumes a flat-plane model for celestial mechanics. This paper proposes that \textbf{solar systems exist within layered, parallel Radiation Coordinate Systems}, interacting through recursive energy transformations. By extending the Unified Theory of Energy to cosmic structures, we uncover an explanation for missing mass, hidden interstellar objects, and nested gravitational fields.
Future work should refine observational methods to detect and confirm \textbf{hidden parallel solar systems} through indirect gravitational mapping and high-sensitivity infrared measurements.
